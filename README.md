# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 

This project provides an implementation of the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO algorithm is a population-based stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. It is used to find the global minimum of a problem, given an objective function. In our case the objective function looks to maximize accuracy for our SVM.
